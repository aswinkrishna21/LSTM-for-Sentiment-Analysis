# LSTM-for-Sentiment-Analysis

My full source code for analyzing tweet sentiment done using LSTMs. Started off with PreProcessing the data and some basic visualisation of the final preprocessed tweet length distribution. PyTorch framework was used in building and running the model. 

Achieved a F1 Score of 0.68 on the Test Set when submitted on Analytics Vidhya (https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-twitter-sentiment-analysis/)
